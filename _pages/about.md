About me
======
I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with [Prof. Andrew Lan](https://people.umass.edu/~andrewlan/) in the Machine Learning for Education (ML4Ed) lab. My primary research focus is utilizing large language models to enable personalized educational recommendation. I have also been working on student modeling, especially knowledge tracing task to predict student performance in computer science education. My most recent work focused on automatic Knowledge Component(KC) generation and combine students KC estimation with knowledge tracing. Welcome to check my recent works in Publications! 

Previously, I received my MS in Computer Science and BS in both Computer Science and Math at UMass Amherst as well. During the master program, I have worked at the UMass Amherst Center for Data Science as a machine learning engineer intern to conduct researches on the #StopAsianHate movement using NLP techniques. At the meantime, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for CS 240: Reasoning Under Uncertainty since 2022.
